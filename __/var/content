<h3>Intro</h3> 
<p>Lightmode is a user interface for websites. The idea is to display
   information on a page like normal, but to add a
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasimode">quasimode</a> that shows parts of the
   page that can be manipulated. Choosing one of these parts pops up an
   arbitrary web application in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window">modal
window</a> (a la <a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/">Lightbox</a>), and when you're done changing the info, you close the app.

<h3>Usage</h3> 
<p>Lightmode is enabled on this page, as the big green &quot;Ready&quot; in the corner indicates. Here's how to test-drive it:
</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> 
     Press and hold &quot;Escape&quot; to enter the Lightmode quasimode.</li> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
     While in this quasimode, click a pane to launch an app to manage the info in that pane.
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
     After you're done with the app, click &quot;Close&quot; or hit &quot;Escape&quot; again.
 </li> 
</ul>

<h3>Wiring</h3> 
<p>Here's how to add Lightmode to a web page:
</p> 
<ul> 
 <li> 
     Include <a href="_lib/jquery.js">jquery.js</a>, <a href="_lib/jquery.dimensions.js">jquery.dimensions.js</a>, <a href="_lib/lightmode.js">lightmode.js</a>, and <a href="_lib/lightmode.css">lightmode.css</a> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
     Add the class &quot;lightmode-pane&quot; to any element that should get its own overlay.
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
     Also add a &quot;run&quot; attribute to each such element, set to the URL of the app to load.
 </li> 
</ul>

<h3>History &amp; Status</h3> 
<p>I first encountered quasimodes in <a href="http://rchi.raskincenter.org/index.php?title=Archy_FAQ">Archy</a>.
   Then I met <a href="http://humanized.com/">Humanized</a>, who are commercializing Archy
   under the name <a href="http://humanized.com/products/">Enso</a>. I wrote Lightmode
   after meeting them. I had been using <a href="http://www.plone.org/">Plone</a> heavily (yes, it's a drug), and Lightmode was basically an experiment in applying quasimodes to a CMS.
</p> 
<p>Now, the first version of Lightmode was actually called Overlight, and I wrote it using <a href="http://mochikit.com/">MochiKit</a> in August 2006. I decided to publish it in February 2007 after talking to <a href="http://www.pagodacms.org/">these guys</a>. I rewrote it in January 2008 for Aza Raskin of Humanized/Mozilla, using <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
</p> 
<p>Thanks to all these folks, but especially to Aza for motivating me to clean this up.
</p> 
<p>I'm not actually using Lightmode anywhere yet, but it's kind of neat, isn't it?
